=== Internationalization support subsystem ===

Some parts of the application (e.g. html output generator & all log function callers) need to format strings, i.e. produce a combination of a predefined string and data. Doing this in printf-like manner is not expansible with custom objects to output. Doing this in a cout-like manner doesn't allow to separate strings from data & requires to write much code.

The decision is to use the following format:
log ("format string: %d %s %d") << 10 << str << 20;

A temporary object is created to hold the format string & all arguments. Object's destructor than prints everything.

Why is this good?
- the temporary object preserves passed argument & checks them => type safety in runtime
- easy to add internationalization support (also, specifiers may be extended to support arbitrary order of arguments)
- compact code
