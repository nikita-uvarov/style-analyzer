// Welcome to our implementation of .ini file format
; You already see it supports C-like and ini-like comments
; Although does not support C++ multi-line ones

; Basic syntax
key = "string value"
allowed_characters_Like_In_C_0123 = ""

; Escapes
key = "some\n\nhard to read\n\nstring, \"hooray!\""

; You see by default value of key is overwritten
; Though you can append
key[] = "has a second value"
key[] = "thus forming a list"
key[] = "suitable/for/storing/file/lists.txt"

; Classical ini sections
[section]
key="Hello"
test="inside section"
[]
test="now outside section (in global scope)"

; With some additions
section.key = "Overwritten you, ha-ha!"

[multiple.nested.sections]
see="hello"
[multiple.nested]
sections.see = "basically section is prepended to name"

; Includes supported, no difference
#include "included.ini"
#include <included.ini>

// Like our syntax?
