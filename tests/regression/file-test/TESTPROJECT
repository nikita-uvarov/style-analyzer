; The following variables need to go to some common base default configuration file
; Basically, all options are passed to a tool through some TESTPROJECT file, either
; existing or through stdin. Some projects do not erase context, so multiple launches
; on multiple files (e. g. inside a build process, when intermediate files may get deleted, patched or whatever
; modified right after processing) are possible.
; A tool that analyses contexts will probably have different option file format.
